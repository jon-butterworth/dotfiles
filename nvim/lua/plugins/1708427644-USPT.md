Purchase team are using AWS API Gateway - `teamsh-api-http01` which was built by Puggelli for multi-team use.
QA-Public API uses Okta as an authorisor

Want to use DyanmoDB but potentiall open to using DocumentDB instead. We would need to provide self service for them to manage the DB or create tables etc.
